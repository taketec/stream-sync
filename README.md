I have been wondering about how I can implement a event based video syncronization app myself since a long time. How hard can it be, there are 3 states of a video playing, playing, paused, buffering so it shouldnt be very hard to sync videos on multiple clients without using something like webrtc right? Well... its not really that simple. This problem arose when some of my friends didnt have very good internet connections to watch videos with webrtc like discord and google meet and thats how I started thinking about it. 

Searching about it I found this article https://levelup.gitconnected.com/tired-of-making-to-do-list-applications-acce875fe617 which explains me exactly what I want. This article is very well written and the code there is very elegant and neat.

Later on I needed a excuse to build a web app for learning web dev so i made this app.
